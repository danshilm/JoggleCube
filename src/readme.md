This directory will contain the source code for the project as stated in Section 2.3 of document [SE QA.08](../docs/qa-docs/seqa8-OperatingProcedures.pdf), including any module tests, arranged into the relevant directories corresponding to their position in the package hierarchy or in other language defined arrangements.<br>
If the project requires more than one program in the system, one sub-directory, appropriately named, may be required for each program. 

Source code should be under configuration control once it is part of the designed system. Before that, it should be put in ***dev***.
