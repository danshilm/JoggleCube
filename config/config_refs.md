A simple table can be made in Markdown like this:

| Tables        | Are           | Easy  |
| ------------- |-------------- | ------|
| Row           | Something     | Value |
| Row           | Something     | Value |
| Row           | Something     | Value |

Check out a handy little cheatsheet that I use quite often [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The QA Manager should get the proper format of this document up and running as soon as they can.
