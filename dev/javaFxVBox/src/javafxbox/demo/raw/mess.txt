Use StringExpression to concatenate the letters that are being selected and print show them in the text field from where we can check for a correct word

In the Controller class, use the initialize method instead of the constructor method as that one has access to the FXML fields referring to components defined in the FXML file

Use fx:id, not id (for CSS)

to change in real time for each selected letter:
// Handle TextField text changes.
myTextField.textProperty().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -> {
    System.out.println("TextField Text Changed (newValue: " + newValue + ")");
});

When creating custom components for FXML, use `*Property` and make sure to add a SETTER for the property
